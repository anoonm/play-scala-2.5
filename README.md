## Play 2.5.13 Template
This template can be used as a jumping-off point for building a Play application. It was adapted from Lightbend's [Play 2.5 Scala Seed](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/play-scala). It includes the executable script `bin/activator`, which can be used to start the application if you don't have `sbt` installed.
